# Appointment No-Show Analysis Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project, *Appointment No-Show Analysis Pipeline*, is an end-to-end data science analysis focused on identifying and addressing factors contributing to missed appointments in a healthcare setting. Appointment no-shows present significant challenges for healthcare providers, resulting in lost revenue and inefficiencies in resource allocation. Using synthetic data reflective of real-world patient statistics, this analysis applies machine learning models and A/B testing to uncover patterns in no-show behavior and evaluate the effectiveness of tailored reminder strategies.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Integration and Preparation**: Merge patient and appointment data, clean, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine trends associated with no-shows, including demographic and behavioral factors, and visualize insights to inform modeling.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build and fine-tune machine learning models to predict the likelihood of patient no-shows.
4. **A/B Testing and Comparative Analysis**: Conduct A/B tests on various patient segments to evaluate the impact of different reminder strategies on attendance rates. The findings from the 2023 data were implemented and tested on a Q1 2024 dataset to validate the effectiveness of the strategies.

## Datasets

- **2023 Synthetic Dataset**: Captures patient demographics, diagnosis, income level, reminder type, transportation method, and historical no-show information. The synthetic data is designed to resemble actual patient statistics to ensure relevance.
- **Q1 2024 Synthetic Dataset**: A follow-up dataset with no-show rates reflecting the strategies implemented based on 2023 analysis findings.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation and Integration
The project begins with data loading, cleaning, and merging steps to create a unified dataset. Unnecessary columns are dropped, and the data is checked for missing values to ensure consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps identify initial insights about patient demographics, diagnoses, reminder methods, and their correlation with no-show rates. Visualizations explore patterns and provide context for the predictive modeling phase.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning models were trained, tested, and evaluated to predict no-shows:
   - **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model to gauge initial predictive power.
   - **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**: Ensemble approaches to capture complex patterns in the data.
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Network**: Additional models to enhance prediction accuracy.
   - **Tuned Models**: Hyperparameter tuning improved the accuracy of models, with specific focus on recall and precision metrics.

The best-performing models in terms of accuracy and recall were Random Forest and SVM. The choice of model depends on the clinic's goals: models with higher recall are preferable for proactive intervention in high-risk no-show cases.

### 4. A/B Testing and Comparative Analysis
Segment-based A/B testing was conducted to analyze no-show rates for different patient groups. Key combinations, such as diagnosis and income level, revealed actionable patterns:
   - **High-income patients without anxiety** benefited from a specific reminder strategy, showing statistically significant differences in no-show rates.
   - **Patients without autism who use public transport** also responded positively to tailored reminders.
   
In Q1 2024, these findings were implemented and validated, showing a statistically significant reduction in no-show rates. A Z-test comparing the original and Q1 2024 data confirmed an improvement in patient attendance, validating the applied strategies.

## Key Results

- **Machine Learning Performance**: Random Forest and SVM models performed best overall, with high accuracy and recall for predicting no-shows.
- **A/B Testing Insights**: While many segments did not show significant differences, targeted strategies for select groups were effective in improving attendance.
- **Q1 2024 Validation**: The new dataset showed a reduced no-show rate, with Group B's no-show rate decreasing from 18.18% to 16.13%, confirmed by Chi-square and Z-tests.

## Project Files

- **Appointment No-Show Analysis Pipeline.ipynb**: Main analysis notebook containing all data loading, cleaning, EDA, modeling, and A/B testing steps.
- **Synthetic Data Files**: CSV files for 2023 and Q1 2024 datasets, reflecting patient information and appointment records.
- **README.md**: Project documentation file providing an overview of the project objectives, workflow, key results, and usage instructions.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and install the required packages (e.g., pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn).

2. **Run Analysis**: Open `Appointment No-Show Analysis Pipeline.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to execute the project workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.

3. **Results Interpretation**: Review the results of each model, as well as the outcomes from the A/B testing and comparative analysis with the Q1 2024 dataset, for insights on effective reminder strategies.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in reducing appointment no-shows in healthcare settings. By integrating machine learning models with refined A/B testing, healthcare providers can tailor reminder strategies to specific patient groups, reducing no-show rates and improving resource utilization. These insights and methodologies can serve as a foundation for further exploration of patient engagement and retention strategies.
